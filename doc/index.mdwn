% Templet for Lua

Templet is a template preprocessor written in pure [Lua], which parses
text templates with embedded Lua statements and Lua expressions. Templet
works with [Lua 5.1], [Lua 5.2], and [LuaJIT].

Consider the example of a system of non-interacting classical particles.
We would like to generate C code that moves the particles by a given
time step. This should work for both 2 and 3 dimensional systems, and
constant parameters should be substituted along the way.

First, the template is parsed, e.g., from a multi-line Lua string:

~~~ {.lua}
local temp = templet.loadstring([[
for (int i = 0; i < ${nparticle}; ++i) {
  |for i = 1, #coord do
  r[i].${coord[i]} = r[i].${coord[i]} + v[i].${coord[i]} * ${timestep};
  |end
}
]])
~~~

The template is then rendered, given a set of parameters:

~~~ {.lua}
local env = {coord = {"x", "y", "z"}, nparticle = 5000, timestep = 0.001}
print(temp(env))
~~~

In the resulting output, the loop has been expanded, and constants
substituted:

    for (int i = 0; i < 5000; ++i) {
      r[i].x = r[i].x + v[i].x * 0.001;
      r[i].y = r[i].y + v[i].y * 0.001;
      r[i].z = r[i].z + v[i].z * 0.001;
    }

~~~ {.lua}
local env = {coord = {"x", "y"}, nparticle = 1000, timestep = 0.002}
print(temp(env))
~~~

The same template can be rendered, e.g., for a 2-dimensional system:

~~~
for (int i = 0; i < 1000; ++i) {
  r[i].x = r[i].x + v[i].x * 0.002;
  r[i].y = r[i].y + v[i].y * 0.002;
}
~~~

The resulting C code could be passed to a just-in-time C compiler for
immediate execution.

I would like to thank Rici Lake for writing the [Slightly Less Simple Lua
Preprocessor], which provided the basis of the Templet parser, as well as
Michal Januszewski and the [Sailfish] contributors for providing a
real-world example of dynamically compiled GPU code templates in a
simulation code.
